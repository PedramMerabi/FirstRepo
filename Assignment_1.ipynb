It's even more interesting when you find out how useless are universities, and how easy it is to be called a \"scientist\" in our new world!!! While all other sciences are suffering from ignorance and lack of investment, this is \"investors' greed and impatience\" that decides the \"sexiest job\" of the era on our poor planet!*"
